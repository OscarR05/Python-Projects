# Python Portfolio
Portfolio of data science projects presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, and .py files

For a more visually pleasant experience for browsing the portfolio, check out hjbok.github.io

*Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only*

## Motivation
This repository would be a shortcut to who wants to improve data-science skills to next-level, as it contains a numerious real-life data science example and notebooks created by @hyunjoonbok and revised from state-of-the-art codes.

As Python is nowadays for #DataScience. I have managed to use the best out of Python to use its full functionality for not only simple EDA, but building a complex ML/DL models.
